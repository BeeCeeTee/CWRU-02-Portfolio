## I. Description
This portfolio was created to showcase some of the work I've done, both up to this point and throughout the course. It was created with the intent of mimicking the example page as closely as possible in structure and appearance, with the exception of some small aesthetic changes. By doing so, I have proven to myself and, hopefully, the instructor/graders that I can take an image of a fully-designed webpage and build it into a functioning static site.
